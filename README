simplergeo.py is a really simple Python wrapper around the SimpleGeo API. It is
derived from the "python-simplegeo" library but made ... well, simpler.

[ PROPER DOCUMENTATION STILL NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN BUT HERE'S THE QUICK AND DIRTY ]

	import simplergeo
	import Geohash

	# http://help.simplegeo.com/faqs/authentication/where-do-i-find-my-oauth-token-and-secret
	# http://simplegeo.com/account/settings/

	token='YER_OAUTH_TOKEN'
	secret='YER_OAUTH_SECRET'
	layer='com.example.layer'

	lat = 37.764845
	lon = -122.419857
	uid = Geohash.encode(lat, lon)

	geo = simplergeo.simplergeo(token=token, secret=secret)

	req = '/records/%s/%s/history.json' % (layer, uid)
	rsp = geo.execute_request_simple(req)

	if rsp['stat'] == 'ok':
		print rsp['geometries']

	# Or, if you want to poke around with the raw bits
	# sent back via the API you can also say:
	#
	# head, body = geo.execute_request(req, foo=bar)
